Beginner fullstack project

Disclaimer: I tried my best respecting good practices but i don't claim this project to be perfect. Don't hesitate to commit though !

Most of the configurations needed are in the settings.py in the comments. 

Feel free to use it as a template for your own personnal project. Here is what you can do with it : https://bakpak.herokuapp.com/bakpak/

I will complete this file later.


Thank you !
